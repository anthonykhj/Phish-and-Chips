# Phish-and-Chips
Analysing phishing website detection using predictive analytics (Random Forest, Neural Networks) on website and URL features to power a safety web extension for Singaporean users.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project tackles Singaporeâ€™s rising phishing threats (e.g., IRAS/DBS scams) by developing a two-tier detection system:

**Technical Approach:**
- Built **Random Forest** models (highest accuracy: 95%) in **R & Python** using 2 datasets (Website Features and Website URL)
- Compared **Logistic Regression/Neural Networks** for robustness

**Deployment:**
- **Singapore Police Force Dashboard**: Trends, hotspots, and model insights for crime prevention
- **Phish and Chips Web Extension**: Real-time warnings with risk factors

**Impact**: Aims to reduce phishing success rates by **alerting users pre-engagement** and supporting **SPFâ€™s proactive interventions**.
